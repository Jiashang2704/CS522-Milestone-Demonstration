# CS522-Milestone

Here is the demonstration of the milestone project as video.

Video description:

Between 0:03 to 0:11, the submenu options are switched by clicking different buttons. From 0:14 to 0:24, various options are displayed and selected. From 0:25 to 0:50, I modify some options and add valid notes to the scroll view. Between 0:50 and 1:01, I attempt to add an invalid note “B5#” (as sharps do not apply to B and E pitches), which is not added to the scroll view, and a brief notification alerts the user before disappearing. From 1:05 to 1:12, two silent (rest) notes are successfully added to the scroll view. From 1:13 to 1:22, I insert more random notes, enabling scrolling to view items at both the top and bottom of the display zone. From 1:23 to 1:31, clicking an item row with the left mouse button removes it from the table. Between 1:32 and 1:39, I add many items, and the “Clear All Notes” button allows for the removal of all notes in the table. From 1:41 to 2:05, the “Load File” button reads notes from “AssetsIn/Sound/notes.txt” in the project directory and loads them into the table; if the file is missing, a notification is displayed. From 2:10 to 2:28, I create and save random notes to the file. From 2:32 to 3:10, the properties of the digital input box are demonstrated. The box is constrained by minimum and maximum values or both, automatically adjusting invalid inputs to valid ranges. Arrow keys navigate the cursor, backspace deletes characters, and pressing ENTER or clicking elsewhere commits the input as a valid float. From 3:12 to 4:06, I compose a melody from C4 to C5 using Sinewaves at 180 BPM, making the music play very fast. At 4:10, I reduce the BPM to 60, slowing down the melody significantly. From 4:25 to 4:32, I return to the game scene to display the sound scene node information, which overlaps due to unchanged locations. Between 4:33 and 5:15, I load and play a predefined notes file, showcasing a melody with various sound notes, durations, and types. The mixed sound types, while demonstrating versatility, result in some notes sounding overly sharp. Finally, from 5:15 to the end, I load and play another predefined file with uniform sound types, producing a smoother melody. This sequence highlights the application's capability to manage and manipulate sound elements effectively.
